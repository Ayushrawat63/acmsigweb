        What is Cryptography..?  
        </div> 
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents.<br> </p>

            <li>Symmetric-key cryptography</li>
            <p>Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way).</p>
            <li>Public-key cryptography</li>
            <p>In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the public key is used for encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption.</p>

                    <p >A cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a form of payment that can circulate without the need for a central monetary authority such as a government or bank.</p>
